    <p>
      As mentioned, eyebrow threading is the process of removing eyebrow hair using a piece of thread. The thread is typically made of cotton and is relatively thin to allow a stronger hold on each strand. 
      Eyebrow threading was practiced in multiple different cultures for several thousand years. 
      While no one knows where it actually originated, the popular theory is that it started in either India or Iran, where a woman would carefully thread her eyebrows for cosmetic and cultural reasons. 
      It was also popular in China, where thin brows were a mark of sophistication.

      A technician will hold a piece of thread between their hands, occasionally with one end in their teeth, and twist it. Theyâ€™ll then hold the end of the twist over the section of hair you want removed and move the thread in a swift motion.
