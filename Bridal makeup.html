    <h1> Bridal makeup</h1>
    <p>
      Cosmetics include skin-care creams, lotions, powders, perfumes, lipsticks, fingernail and toe nail polish, eye and facial makeup, towelettes, permanent waves, colored contact lenses, hair colors, hair sprays and gels, deodorants, hand sanitizer, baby products, bath oils, bubble baths, bath salts, butters and many other types of products. A subset of cosmetics is called "make-up," which refers primarily to coloring products intended to alter the user’s appearance. Many manufacturers distinguish between decorative cosmetics and care cosmetics.

      Most cosmetics are distinguished by the area of the body intended for application.<br><br><br>
      
      Primer, comes in various formulas to suit individual skin conditions. Most are meant to reduce the appearance of pore size, prolong the wear of makeup, and allow for a smoother application of makeup, and are applied before foundation.<br><br>
      
      Lipgloss, is a sheer, liquid form of lipstick. Lipstick, lip gloss, lip liner, lip plumper, lip balm, lip conditioner, lip primer, and lip boosters.
      Lip stains have a water or gel base and may contain alcohol to help the product stay on the lips. The idea behind lip stains is to temporarily saturate the lips with a dye, rather than to cover them with a colored wax. Usually designed to be waterproof, the product may come with an applicator brush or be applied with a finger.
      
      Concealer, makeup used to cover any imperfections of the skin. Concealer is often used for any extra coverage needed to cover blemishes or other marks. Concealer is often thicker and more solid than foundation, and provides longer lasting, more detailed coverage. Some formulations are meant only for the eye or only for the face.<br><br><br>
      
      Foundation, is used to smooth out the face and cover spots or uneven skin coloration. Usually a liquid, cream, or powder, as well as most recently a light and fluffy mousse, foundation also provides excellent coverage. Foundation primer can be applied before or after foundation to obtain a smoother finish. Some primers come in powder or liquid form to be applied before foundation as a base, while other primers come as a spray to be applied after the foundation to help the make-up last longer.
      
      Face powder, is used to set the foundation, giving it a matte finish, and also to conceal small flaws or blemishes.<br><br><br>
      
      Rouge, blush or blusher is cheek coloring used to bring out the color in the cheeks and make the cheekbones appear more defined. Rouge comes in powder, cream, and liquid forms.
      
      Contour powder/creams, are used to define the face. They can be used to give the illusion of a slimmer face or to modify a person’s face shape in other desired ways. Usually a few shades darker than one's own skin tone and matte in finish, contour products create the illusion of depth. A darker toned foundation/concealer can be used instead of contour products for 
      a more natural look.<br><br><br>

<p>
      Highlight, used to draw attention to the high points of the face as well as to add glow to the face, comes in liquid, cream, and powder forms. 
      It often contains shimmer, but sometimes does not. A lighter toned foundation/concealer can be used instead of highlight to create a more natural look.
      Bronzer, is used to give skin a bit of color by adding a golden or bronze glow. It comes in either matte, semi matte/satin, or shimmer finishes.
      Mascara, is used to darken, lengthen, and thicken the eyelashes. It is available in natural colors such as brown and black, but also comes in bolder colors such as blue, pink, or purple. 
      There are many different formulas, including waterproof versions for those prone to allergies or sudden tears. It is often used after an eyelash curler and mascara primer. 
      Many mascaras now have certain components intended to help lashes to grow longer and thicker.
      Eyelash glue, is used to adhere false lashes to the eyes. It comes in either clear or colored formulas.<br><br><br>
      Eyebrow pencils, creams, waxes, gels and powders are used to color and define the brows.
      Nail polish, is used to color the fingernails and toenails.
      Setting Spray, is used to keep applied makeup intact for long periods of time. An alternative to setting spray is setting powder, 
      which may be either pigmented or translucent.
      Cosmetics can be also described by the physical composition of the product. Cosmetics can be liquid or cream emulsions; powders, both pressed and loose; dispersions; and anhydrous creams or sticks.
      Eyeliner, is used to enhance and elongate the size of the eye. Makeup remover, is a product used to remove the makeup products applied on the skin. 
      It is used to clean the skin before other procedures, like applying bedtime lotion.</p>
